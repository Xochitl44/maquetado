    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</H2>
    <p>
        Please read these Terms of Use <span class="boldText">("Terms")</span>carefully as they govern your use of
        (which
        includes access to)
        Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and
        software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the <span class="boldText">"Spotify
            Service")</span> and any
        music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service
        <span class="boldText">("Content")</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the Spotify Privacy Policy and additional terms and conditions
        presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.
    </p>
    <p>
        By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to
        these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
    </p>

    <p>
        THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES
        THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT
        PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN
        COURT.
    </p>

    <h3>Service provider</h3>
    <p>These Terms are between you and Spotify USA Inc., 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New
        York, NY, 10007.</p>

    <h3>Age and eligibility requirements</h3>
    <p>
        BY USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OR OLDER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS, OR, IF YOU
        ARE NOT, THAT YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR OLDER AND HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THESE
        TERMS. Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you represent that: you reside

        and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
    </p>

    <h1 id="spotifyService">2. The Spotify Service</h1>
    <h3>Spotify Service options</h3>
    <p>
        We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while
        other options require payment before they can be accessed <span>("Paid Subscriptions")</span>. We may also offer
        special
        promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are
        not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.
    </p>

    <h3> Trials</h3>
    <p>
        From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period
        without payment or at a reduced rate <span>("Trial")</span>. By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree
        to the Spotify
        Paid Subscription Terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-party applications, devices and open source software</h3>

    <p>
        The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites,
        and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable
        devices, speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be
        subject to additional terms, conditions, and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify
        does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with the Spotify Service.
    </p>

    <h3>Service limitations and modifications</h3>

    <p>
        We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized,
        immersive audio experience. However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify Service offerings and
        their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you. For example:
    </p>

    <p>
        The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or
        testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.

        We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or
        temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features,
        subscription plans, and promotional offerings).

        Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the
        applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior
        to the end of your Prepaid Period (as that term is defined in the "Payments and cancellations" section below),
        Spotify will refund you the prorated portion of the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such
        discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or
        other Spotify Service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third
        parties, or events beyond our control.
    </p>

    <h1 id="">3. Your Use of the Spotify Service</h1>

    <h3>Creating a Spotify account</h3>

    <p>
        You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and password
        are for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You understand that you are responsible for all
        use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our Customer Service team immediately
        if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your
        account.

    </p>

    <p>
        Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.
